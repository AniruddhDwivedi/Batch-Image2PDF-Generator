# Batch-Image2PDF-Generator
PDF file generation software made with python to create a pdf using several images.

## Purpose
I couldn't find any software that was easy enough to use and create a pdf with using automation, given that my data was already ordered.
This application enables any user with basic knowledge of python and its image library to easily create a pdf with several image files without having to keep looking for clunky software provided on the rest of the web.

## Usage
Using QT, the application allows anyone to easily understand its use and intuitively provides functionality for the basic use case.

## Installation
Just clone the git repository, then run the command

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

followed by

```python3 main.py```

and the application will run

## Future Updates
I plan to add recursive file searching in the next version and fix some other bugs that may arise upon further testing.
